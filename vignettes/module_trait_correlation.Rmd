In this tutorial, we cover how to relate co-expression modules to biological and
technical variables. Before starting this tutorial, make sure that you
have constructed the co-expression network as in the [hdWGCNA basics](articles/basics_tutorial.html).

First Load the snRNA-seq data and the required libraries:
```{r eval=FALSE}

# single-cell analysis package
library(Seurat)

# plotting and data science packages
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(patchwork)

# co-expression network analysis packages:
library(WGCNA)
library(hdWGCNA)

# using the cowplot theme for ggplot
theme_set(theme_cowplot())

# load the Zhou et al snRNA-seq dataset
seurat_ref <- readRDS('data/Zhou_control.rds')

```

## Compute correlations

Here we use the function `ModuleTraitCorrelation` to correlate selected variables
with module eigengenes. This function computes correlations for specified groupings
of cells, since we can expect that some variables may be correlated with certain
modules in certain cell groups but not in others. There are certain types of
variables that can be used for this analysis while others should not be used.

**Variables that can be used**

* Numeric variables
* Categorical variables with only 2 categories, such as "control" and "condition".
* Categorical variables with a sequential relationship. For example, you may have a
  "disease stage" category ordered by "healthy", "stage 1", "stage 2", "stage 3", etc.
  In this case, you must ensure that the variable is stored as a factor and that
  the levels are set appropriately.

**Variables that can not be used**

* Categorical variables with more than two categories that are not sequentially linked.
For example, suppose you have a dataset consiting of three strains of transgenic mice
and one control. Categorical variables must be converted to numeric before running the
correlation, so you will end up with a correlation that is not at all biologically
meaningful since there's not a way to order the three different strains in a way that
makes sense as a numeric variable. In this case, you should just set up a pairwise correlation between
control and each strain separately. We often have a "Sample ID" variable indicating
which cell came from which sample, and this is a variable that does not necessarily
make sense to order in any particular way, so a variable like this would not be
suitable for module-trait correlation analysis.

```{r eval=FALSE}

# convert sex to factor
seurat_obj$msex <- as.factor(seurat_obj$msex)

# convert age_death to numeric
seurat_obj$age_death <- as.numeric(seurat_obj$age_death)

# list of traits to correlate
cur_traits <- c('braaksc', 'pmi', 'msex', 'age_death', 'doublet_scores', 'nCount_RNA', 'nFeature_RNA', 'total_counts_mt')

seurat_obj <- ModuleTraitCorrelation(
  seurat_obj,
  traits = cur_traits,
  group.by='cell_type'
)

```

For any categorical variables used, this function prints out a warning message
to tell the user what order the categories are listed in, just to make sure that it
makes sense.

<details> <summary> See warning message </summary>

```
Warning message:
In ModuleTraitCorrelation(seurat_obj, traits = cur_traits, group.by = "cell_type") :
  Trait msex is a factor with levels 0, 1. Levels will be converted to numeric IN THIS ORDER for the correlation, is this the expected order?
```

</details>

### Inspecting the output

We can run the function `GetModuleTraitCorrelation` to retrieve the output of this
function.

```{r eval=FALSE}

# get the mt-correlation results
mt_cor <- GetModuleTraitCorrelation(seurat_obj)

names(mt_cor)

```

```
[1] "cor"  "pval" "fdr"
```

`mt_cor` is a list containing three items; `cor` which holds the correlation results,
`pval` which holds the correlation p-values, and `fdr` which holds the FDR-corrected p-values.

Each of these items is a list where each element is a dataframe for each of the
correlation tests that were performed.

```{r eval=FALSE}
names(mt_cor$cor)
```

```
[1] "all_cells" "INH"       "EX"        "OPC"       "ODC"       "ASC"
[7] "MG"
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
 head(mt_cor$cor$INH[,1:5])
```

```
INH-M1       INH-M2       INH-M3      INH-M4        INH-M5
braaksc         0.040786737  0.090483529 -0.032898347  0.07570061 -0.0156434561

```

## Plot Correlation Heatmap

We can plot the results of our correlation analysis using the
`PlotModuleTraitCorrelation` function. This function creates a separate heatmap
for each of the correlation matrices, and then assembles them into one plot
using patchwork.

```{r eval=FALSE}

PlotModuleTraitCorrelation(
  seurat_obj,
  label = 'fdr',
  label_symbol = 'stars',
  text_size = 2,
  text_digits = 2,
  text_color = 'white',
  high_color = 'yellow',
  mid_color = 'black',
  low_color = 'purple',
  plot_max = 0.2,
  combine=TRUE
)

```
