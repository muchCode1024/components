* I installed pkgdown on my laptop locally under the "seurat" conda env
`conda activate seurat`

* This command builds the site and previews it
`pkgdown::build_site()`

* This is the .yml configuration file for the actual pkgdown site:
https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/blob/main/pkgdown/_pkgdown.yml


Need to make function documentation before building the package!!!
This is done with the following command from the main directory in the pacakge scWGCNA/:
Found this here: https://tinyheero.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/07/26/making-your-first-R-package.html
```

# document the functions
devtools::document()

# build the site:
pkgdown::build_site()

```

To group functions together in the reference page, you need to maually add them
in the .yml config file. Currently I have only put a few functions in each group
so there's more I need to add. This is also nice since we can just easily ignore
random helper functions.
